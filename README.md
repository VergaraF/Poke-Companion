# Poke-Companion
My first complex iOS app. Coded in Swift.
This iOS app is a companion for the famous game Pokemon GO.


Unfortunately, I haven't been able to figure out how to upload over 100mb files to github... so I haven't been able to upload this project. I may just ignore all my pods (the heave files) and upload it; however, I've read that ignoring cocoapods is not ideal.
